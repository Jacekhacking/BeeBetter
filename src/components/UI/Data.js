She has incredible knowledge of the anatomy of the body and how the difference muscle groups interact to support each other. I highly recommend her without any reservation. You won't regret using her services.",

I bruise really easily and she’s great at finding the right pressure for the massage without leaving me covered in bruises. I would highly recommend her. ",

She details what she is doing and why as she goes along and really cares about educating you on your body and muscles. I even got recommendations for stretches and things to do after my massage. She has a good education and background in athletic training and massage treatment. The environment she creates is calm and inviting. I highly recommend going to see Alora!"
